* Image sizes .. steps for each image..
* an idea would be to take the width / height.. and quantize the sizes into 4 chunks.. (as long as different by 100 pixels each) and save those.. we should do this for each new image that comes through the system => NEAT, cuz this is again predictable fetching!!! blamo.
